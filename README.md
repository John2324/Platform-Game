Platform Game

My first platform game using open source tools and free tilesets.

I created this game using the instructions that are provided in the following book:
"The Web Game Developer's Cookbook: Using JavaScript and HTML 5 to Develop Games" by Evan Burchard.


The recipe for this game is in Chapter 5 of the book.
