Platform Game

My first platform game using open source tools free tilesets, and the MelonJS engine.

I created this game using the instructions that are provided in the following book:
"The Web Game Developer's Cookbook: Using JavaScript and HTML 5 to Develop Games" by Evan Burchard.


This is my take on the recipe for this game, which is in Chapter 5 of the book.
